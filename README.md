#Welcome to my homework repo

I admit, I edited this file in nano.  What can I say, I like shell-based text editors.

Sometimes I even --use vi-- hit myself in the head.

OK, that's not true. I think my [https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/scicomp/staff/regetz](former vi teacher) would be sad to hear me say that.

It *is* more efficient than nano if you know what you are doing. Perhaps I should releard it.

OK, I will now.

1. Save this file.
2. Commit this file (using nano to write my commit message).
3. Push the repo.
